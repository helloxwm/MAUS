## Abstract: 
Animal microbiota (including human microbiota) plays an important role in keeping the physiological status of the host healthy. Research activity into understanding whether changes in the composition and function of the microbiota are associated with disease is increasing. We analyzed 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing (SMS) published data from the gut microbiota of 99 individuals monitored over time. Temporal fluctuations in the microbial composition revealed significant differences due to factors such as dietary changes, antibiotic intake, age and disease. This article shows that a fluctuation scaling law describes the temporal changes in the gut microbiota. This law enables the temporal variability of the microbial population to be estimated and quantitatively characterizes the path toward disease via a noise-induced phase transition. The estimation of the systemic parameters for follow-up studies may have clinical use and, more generally, may also have applications in other fields where it is important to know whether a given community is stable or not.

## Importance:
Human microbiota is closely linked to the health status of a person. This article analyzes the microbial composition of several subjects under different conditions, over a time span that ranged from days to months. Using the Langevin equation as the basis of our mathematical framework in order to evaluate microbial temporal stability, we proved that stable microbiotas can be distinguished from unstable microbiotas. This first step will help us to determine how microbiota temporal stability is related to the healthiness of people, and it will enable the development of a more comprehensive framework in order to obtain more in-depth knowledge of this complex system.
